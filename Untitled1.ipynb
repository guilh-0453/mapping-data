Head trained and dry farmed, these vineyards give nice raspberry fruits. Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel also makes a big impact on the blend in Batch #004. Dry Creek is a classic and well known source for great Zinfandel and has added a new dimension to the 1000 Stories blend. Black fruits with distinct notes of black pepper and even a bit of clove spice add complexity to the blend. Also new to this batch is the addition of Lodi Zinfandel, with its iconic bold flavors and big character. Rounding out the blend are some Zinfandels from Colusa County, Syrah from Paso Robles and Petite sirah from Mendocino. A portion of the wine is aged in French and American oak for 6 months and then aged further in bourbon barrels. We\\u2019ve selected new and used bourbon barrels for these small batches of Zinfandel, which impart characteristics specific to these barrels: charred vanilla, dried herbs and a hint of caramel.\",\"5\":\"1,000 Stories Bourbon barrel-aged Zinfandel is a harmonious balance of Zinfandel grapes from Mendocino and Sonoma counties which are bursting with aromatic red fruit scents and complex black fruit flavors. A touch of Petite Sirah and Syrah enhance those flavors even more with bold black and white pepper spices. The batch is then rounded out with a layer of smokiness derived from the new bourbon barrel aging.\",\"6\":\"Batch 55 embodies an opulent vintage, which saw its fruit grow amid lush rainfall and balmy temperatures. Nuanced aromas of sun-baked raspberry, crushed blueberry, freshly-turned earth and hints of nutmeg swirl in the glass, segueing to a palate of jammy blackberries, clove and caramel. This blend showcases Zinfandel\\u2019s warm, luscious character, accentuated by time spent in our charred bourbon barrels, which lent a graceful, smoky finish to the wine.\",\"31\":\"Gnarly Head 1924 Double Black delivers rich aromas of blackberry preserves, cocoa, raspberry and caramel, setting the stage for a juicy core of concentrated, dense blackberry and fig jam flavors that finish with a hint of baking spice.

The citrus and apricot flavors are accompanied by very high acidity.\",\"1629\":\"This rich red is a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 15% Mourvedre.  It was given a more serious winemaking regimen with a bit more new oak. I also chose a \\\"bigger\\\" Syrah to blend in with the Grenache and Mourvedre, so the resulting wine is a bit more \\\"profound\\\". I think that it is perhaps the best Esp\\u00e9rance that we have ever released.

The smooth, resolved palate has a clean, well-balanced acidity that ties up neatly with an understated creamy, caramel finish.\",\"2761\":\"Ruby red and purple in hue, this wine has aromas of ripe red fruit, with hints of sage, cinnamon and pepper. The fruit flavors flesh out on the palate, dominated by raspberry, boysenberry and red cherry, complemented by hints of nutmeg, rosemary and spice, for a classic varietal character. Soft, supple tannins create a firm, yet lush mouthfeel. With its bright fruit-forward flavor profile, this wine is created for immediate enjoyment.\",\"2895\":\"Isabelle is comprised of the best cuvees each year from all the wines Au Bon Climat produces and that represents at least 6 different vineyards. The 2012 is a darker, luscious, fruitier Isabelle. It has an intensely perfumed, black raspberry nose with sexy floral and mineral qualities that gain power with air. This one needed no bottle time to show well. Isabelle has proven to age very well, and we routinely drink bottles with 15 years of age. Even though Isabelle is Au Bon Climat's \\\"biggest\\\" Pinot Noir with loads of intensity and power, it is still balanced and food friendly.\",\"2896\":\"Isabelle is comprised of only the best cuvees each vintage. Consequently, it is consistently a top performing Pinot Noir year to year. Dark, rich, and layered, this regal wine is remarkable now, but will be even more integrated and complex in time. \",\"2897\":\"Isabelle is unlike any other Au Bon Climat Pinot Noir. Our top Pinot Noirs prior to making Isabelle in 1994 were all single vineyard wines. Isabelle was the first top end Pinot Noir that was a blend from different locations. After the birth of his daughter in 1995, Jim Clendenen wanted to make a special wine in her honor. Isabelle has developed into a unique young woman and her wine is unique for Au Bon Climat, a blended, high-end Pinot Noir. \",\"2898\":\"Part of our elite \\\"Blue Series\\\", Isabelle is comprised of only the best cuvees each vintage. Consequently, it is consistently our top performing Pinot Noir year to year. The 2016 is particularly dark, rich, and complex.\",\"2924\":\"This wine is just easy to drink. Whether with fresh grilled salmon or left-over roast chicken or just in a glass by itself, the pretty plum and spring strawberry flavors of ABC SB Pinot are simply delicious. There is nothing pretentious here, just well balanced, nicely textured, brightly fruity wine that seems to go with everything.\",\"2926\":\"This wine has a firmness and a lean, dry structure that creates the impression of clean and cleansing. A hint of rose petals and light tannins.\",\"3253\":\"This aromatic wine is much more complex than a straight forward Cabernet. The bold, fresh cherry and red fruit flavors incorporate vanilla and oak spice. The bouquet is equally full and expressive. A luscious, balanced wine with great acidity. Beautiful color and rich texture.\",\"3254\":\"The deep concentration of red currant in the nose and aftertaste can only be achieved by the best Cabernet. A complex and elegant wine full of rich, ripe fruit with a long and intense finish. The integration of acids and linear tannins signified a wine that will age well.\",\"3255\":\"This is a full, deep and provocative wine. It has rich, dark color with aromas of ripe blackberry, a hint of chocolate and the vanilla of new oak the palate is very well balanced and highlighted by an engaging mouth-filling yet supple texture. Although it retains the alluring nose, color and youthful drinkability of prior vintages, this is a wine for the cellar.\",\"3256\":\"This classic vintage, with its extended summer, produced a wine with longevity and worthy of many years of cellar aging. It boasts black fruit flavors, intermixed with a cavalcade of subtle nutty and vanilla oak flavors. The pure Cabernet married perfectly with the more acidic and strawberry Sangiovese and is buttressed by the dark Petit Sirah. This is a beautifully balanced and exotic blend.\",\"3257\":\"The 98' vintage was significantly lower in yield than normal. Spring was cool and hang-time long, producing small, well-spaced berry clusters' with concentrated flavors. This was an outstanding vintage! The aroma is definably Bacio Divino... rich Cabernet aromas abound but with added complexity from the berry\\/cherry nose brought forward by the Sangiovese. This vintage has a rich and warm texture. Overall, the wine is mature enough for immediate appeal but with sufficient structure to ensure a long life.\",\"3352\":\"This full-bodied Syrah is a wine of tremendous concentration from the Paso Robles appellation. Four different vineyards make up this wine with each site bringing its own unique characteristics to the final blend.

Fresh cherries and white pepper spice as well as gravel minerality and black tea are also prevalent. The mouth feel is fleshy, deceivingly full given the color. Brown sugar and crushed red currant are abundant on the palate, with soft tannin and firm acid rounding out the wine. This beautifully balanced wine will age gracefully over the next 7 years, from 2009 to 2016.\",\"3667\":\"Rich and complex, drawing on pear, citrus, hazelnut, and mineral flavors, all framed in a creamy-smooth texture with plenty of toasty oak. \",\"3794\":\"Dark ruby-violet color. Ripe vanilla-blackberry jam aromas with hints of black pepper. Medium-full bodied flavors, with bold peppery-spicy dark chocolate-accents. Moderate yet firm, ripe tannins, balanced with good acidity add structure and youthful vigor. A gutsy wine that is more \\\"brambly\\\" than previous versions, this Beauzeaux is no joke, however, and would be great with BBQ, and all kinds of grilled meats.

It is about 88% Zinfandel blended with Petite Sirah, Carignan, Alicante Bouschet, and many different interplanted varieties that maintain poise and add complexity and structure.  This has plenty of juiciness and should be delightful in the nearer term with a good decant; however, as many have discovered this wine will age gracefully and improve with time in bottle.\",\"3983\":\"The base of wine is composed around the ancient plantings of Mourvedre at Bedrock Vineyard and Pagani Ranch, the rest of the blend is composed of dry-farmed Grenache planted in the 1880\\u2019s at Gibson Ranch in McDowell Valley and Carignane from the 1950\\u2019s planted on soils that remind the winemaker of Pauillac in Ukiah.\",\"4244\":\"Beran California Zinfandel 2012 is a true representation of what Zinfandel can offer with the ripeness of the warmer regions and brightness from the cooler regions. Grapes picked at optimum ripeness combined with extended fruit maceration over 30 days at times then laid to rest for 12 months in a combination of American and French oak has created a flavor-packed, easy-drinking Zin with a soft, supple mouthfeel and balanced acidity. Zinfandel is one of the most expressive and distinctive grape varieties and when made well should continue to evolve and improve in the bottle.\",\"4290\":\"Aged 60 days in American Oak Bourbon barrels, this bold and unruly Chardonnay shows flavors of baked Golden apples, toasted almonds, and a buttery finish.\",\"4470\":\"Pinot Noir is a grape with attitude. It wants things its own way-including terrain and temperature during both growing and winemaking-and it responds well only to tender, not tough, handling. But I think it is well worth the effort. When Pinot Noir is good, it is very, very good, complex and subtle at the same time, with layers and layers of flavor to be teased out. I consider this grape varietal doubly rewarding when things work well, as I believe they did in this very special vintage. To me, this wine is mouthfilling and very fruit-forward, with loads of bright berry and plum aromas and flavors, layered with cigar-box cedar, sweet vanilla, a touch of a mint, and an elusive light smokiness. -Ed Sbragia, Winemaster\",\"4736\":\"The 2014 Homestead is comprised of 35% Mourvedre, 27% Grenache, 19% Carignane, 16% Syrah & 3% Cabernet Sauvignon.

French and American oak make a lasting impression, leaving this wine with a balanced finish of toasted spices and refined tannins.\",\"6167\":\"It is lean, neither overly alcoholic nor overly extracted, nor overly oaked; it is precisely what one would imagine A Proper Claret to be. The wine contains a substantial dollop of Petit Verdot, adding a silky note of violets and textural elegance, in counterpoint to the lead-in-the-pencil firmness offered by the inclusion of the virile Tannat. Tannat, the grape implicated in the French paradox (and the vinifera variety with resveratrol levels that are off the charts), is principally grown in Gascony (land of Les Trois Mousquetaires), though it was historically grown as well in Bordeaux as late as the 19th century.Comparing this wine with the 2012 APC, the inaugural vintage, the '13 version is a bit plusher and posher, with softer tannins, not unreminiscent of the overstuffed chair at one's Club.

And why would they not sip ros\\u00e9, a potation which  so strongly evokes the invigorating fragrance of wild aromatic herbs and botanicals common to the south of France?  The 2004 Vin Gris is not the pudgy, alcoholic endomorph one might expect from such a hot, early year. In fact, the acid is a bit more  pronounced compared to the previous vintage, perhaps because the wine is once again bone dry, unlike the ever so confected 2003. This  2004 is indeed one of the more classically styled editions of Vin Gris to date. All the signifiers we have come to associate with classic  Proven\\u00e7al style ros\\u00e9 are there\\u2014a definite suggestion of aromatic herbs, citrus rind, rosehips and hibiscus along with a very pleasing,  mild astringency on the back palate. This makes for a delicious ap\\u00e9ritif, and allows the wine to pair much more elegantly with a wide  variety of foods. Here one might imagine poached salmon, assorted birds or, if one fancies oneself a true Proven\\u00e7al, a bowl of  bouillabaisse or a generous portion of ratatouille.\",\"6212\":\"We continue down the primrose path of insinuating a substantial dollop of white wine\\u2014principally grenache blanc\\u2014into our typical blend of red varieties. Though not a technique practiced widely in Vin Gris' spiritual homeland of Provence, we find the addition of rich white wine adds some incremental gravity and seriousness without jeopardizing the final blend's personal and electrochemical vivacity\\u2014a quality critical in the perfect aperitif, or if one wishes to wash down a Salade Ni\\u00e7oise under the hot sun of St. Tropez. 2005 was much cooler than its predecessor and we find brighter, filigreed fruit notes here\\u2014watermelon, cranberry and strawberry guava.

Hints of wild strawberry, white cherry, apple blossom, and the barest whiff of spearmint. Palate is quite dry and zesty with pale red fruits, blood orange, citrus, and a lean yet supple finish. But what is most compelling about the wine is its elegance. We deployed far less skin contact than in years past, and in this instance, less is truly more.

We had rain and cold in April, warm May days, showers in June and thunderstorms in July. Go figure. While we worried about rain during harvest, we found instead a beautiful Indian Summer that let grapes hang and develop full flavors, with higher acids that lead to this vintage having a bright, crisp showing that should be very pleasing. Flavors were even more concentrated as most vineyards found yields for Chardonnay 20-30% below average, allowing vines to concentrate energy in the fruit. Judicious shoot thinning and the careful eye that comes with organic farming led, in the end, to one of the most memorable vintages of the new century so far. \",\"6231\":\"An initial impression of rich, buttery cream quickly turns to aromas of honey and lightly toasted almonds, followed by tropical aromas of pineapple, citrusy lemon and cr\\u00e8me brulee.
